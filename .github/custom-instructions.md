# üöÄ Full Stack Best Practices

This guide outlines **best practices** for building the **Quiz Builder and Hosting Platform**, covering frontend, backend, database, deployment, and testing. The goal is **readability, clarity, maintainability, scalability, security, and CI/CD readiness**.

---

## üìÅ Project Structure

Maintain a **clean, conventional, modular, and organized project structure**:

```

/app
/Http
/Controllers   # Resource controllers (QuizController, AdminController, AuthController, ResultController)
/Middleware    # Custom middleware (e.g. Admin authentication)
/Models          # Eloquent models (Quiz, Question, User, Result)
/Policies        # Authorization policies (if used)
/Services        # Business logic services (e.g. scoring logic)

/resources
/views
/layouts       # Blade layouts (app.blade.php)
/partials      # Reusable Blade partials (navbar, footer, alerts)
/auth          # Login and registration views
/admin         # Admin dashboard, quiz builder views
/user          # User dashboard, quiz attempt, results views
/sass            # SASS modules (\_variables.scss, \_quiz.scss, \_admin.scss, etc.)
/js
timer.js       # Countdown timer functionality
quiz.js        # AJAX quiz interactions
app.js         # General scripts initialization
/css
app.css        # Compiled CSS

/routes
web.php          # Web routes grouped by middleware

/database
/migrations      # DB schema migrations
/seeders         # Seeders for demo data
/factories       # Model factories for testing

/public
/assets          # Images, compiled JS, CSS

/tests
/Feature         # Feature tests (auth, quiz flows)
/Unit            # Unit tests (score calculation logic)

.github
/workflows       # GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines

.env               # Environment configuration
composer.json      # PHP dependencies
package.json       # JS dependencies
webpack.mix.js     # Laravel Mix configuration

```

üîñ **Rules:**

- **Flat is better than deeply nested**; keep modules organized by feature.
- **No generic ‚Äòhelpers‚Äô folder**; place utilities in Services or within feature modules.
- Keep **controllers thin**, **services focused**, **models clean**, and **views logic-free**.

## ‚öõÔ∏è Frontend UI & Styling Best Practices

‚úÖ **Component & Blade Partial Guidelines:**

1. Extract Blade partials for **reusable UI blocks** (quiz cards, alerts, navbar, footer).
2. Write **custom styles in SASS modules**, compile using Laravel Mix.
3. Use **Bootstrap utility classes** first before adding custom CSS for rapid development.
4. Follow **BEM naming conventions** in custom CSS for clarity and maintainability.

‚úÖ **Accessibility Guidelines:**

- Use **semantic HTML tags** for structure (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<button>`).
- Implement **ARIA labels and roles** for timers, dynamic quiz elements.
- Ensure **keyboard navigability** for forms, quiz options, and buttons.
- Maintain **sufficient color contrast** for readability.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è JavaScript & AJAX Best Practices

‚úÖ **Key Guidelines:**

- Use **vanilla JS with clean DOM selectors** and event delegation.
- Organize JS by feature (timer.js, quiz.js) for modularity.
- Use **AJAX for dynamic quiz submission**; handle success and errors gracefully with user-friendly feedback.
- Always **protect AJAX POST requests with CSRF tokens**.

---

## üîê Backend (Laravel / PHP / MySQL) Best Practices

‚úÖ **Controller & Service Layer:**

- Use **RESTful resource controllers**.
- Delegate business logic to **Services** to keep controllers thin.
- Validate incoming data using **Form Request classes**.

‚úÖ **Database & Models:**

- Use **normalized relational schemas** with proper foreign keys.
- Define clear **Eloquent relationships** (Quiz hasMany Questions, User hasMany Results).
- Apply all schema changes via **Laravel migrations** only.

‚úÖ **Authentication & Authorization:**

- Implement **role-based access control** using an `is_admin` field or roles table.
- Protect admin routes with **custom middleware**.
- Use **Laravel Breeze or Jetstream** for authentication scaffolding.

---

## üß™ Testing Best Practices

‚úÖ **PHPUnit Testing:**

- **Feature tests** for:
  - User registration/login flows
  - Quiz creation/edit/deletion (admin)
  - Quiz attempt and scoring (user)
- **Unit tests** for:
  - Score calculation logic
  - Utility service methods

‚úÖ **Manual Testing Flow:**

- Verify:
  - User registration and login flows
  - Quiz builder (creation, editing, deletion)
  - Quiz attempt with timer and auto-submit
  - Score calculation accuracy
  - Dashboard views for user and admin

‚úÖ **JavaScript Testing:**

- JS testing can be minimal initially. Expand with Jest or similar in future enhancements.

---

## üöÄ CI/CD Deployment Best Practices

‚úÖ **GitHub Actions Setup:**

- Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for automated testing on push/pull request:
  - Run `composer install`
  - Run `npm install && npm run dev` (if required for builds)
  - Run `php artisan migrate --env=testing`
  - Run PHPUnit tests

- Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for deployment on push to `main`:
  - SSH into production server
  - Pull latest code
  - Run `composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader`
  - Run `npm install && npm run prod`
  - Run `php artisan migrate --force`
  - Restart PHP-FPM / queue workers if used

‚úÖ **General Deployment Guidelines:**

- Never commit `.env` files; manage secrets securely.
- Test on **staging environment** before production deploy.
- Use **`php artisan config:cache`** and **`route:cache`** for optimized performance.
- Keep **backups and rollback plans** ready before each deploy.

---

## üîí Security Best Practices

‚úÖ **Key Guidelines:**

- Always use **Laravel‚Äôs built-in protections** against SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
- Hash passwords with **bcrypt (default)**.
- Validate all inputs **server-side**, regardless of frontend validations.
- Sanitize user-generated content displayed in views to prevent XSS.
- Use **HTTPS** in production for all user data transmission.

---

By following these **end-to-end best practices**, the **Quiz Builder and Hosting Platform** will remain **scalable, secure, maintainable, and CI/CD-ready**, ensuring reliable delivery and long-term project success.

# Bonus Instructions 
(Do consider the worthful and necessary unmatched instructions to above instructions)

üîñ **Rules:**

- **Use RESTful resource controllers** (e.g., QuizController handles index, create, store, edit, update, delete).
- **Use Laravel Eloquent relationships** for quizzes, questions, and users.
- **No business logic in routes/web.php** ‚Äì delegate to controllers.
- **Use Blade templating for views**, keep minimal logic in views.
- **Organize JavaScript files per feature module** (timer.js, quiz.js) for clarity.
- **Keep CSS structured**, use Bootstrap utility classes before writing custom CSS.

## ‚öõÔ∏è Blade Component Best Practices

‚úÖ **When to Create a New Blade Component**

1. **If a UI block is reused across pages** (e.g. alert messages, quiz cards).
2. **If it enhances readability** by extracting complex HTML structures.
3. **If it encapsulates a single responsibility** (e.g. quiz attempt form).

  ```blade
  {{-- ‚ùå BAD: Repeated HTML in multiple views --}}
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-header">Quiz Title</div>
    <div class="card-body">...</div>
  </div>

  {{-- ‚úÖ GOOD: Blade Component --}}
  <x-quiz.card :quiz="$quiz" />
  ````

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Database Design Best Practices

‚úÖ **Key Guidelines:**

* **Use migrations** for all schema changes.
* **Define foreign keys and constraints** for data integrity (e.g. questions table references quizzes).
* **Seeders** for dummy quizzes, questions, and users for testing/demo.

---

## üîê Authentication & Authorization Best Practices

‚úÖ **Key Guidelines:**

* Use **Laravel Breeze or Jetstream** for authentication scaffolding.
* **Role-based authorization**: differentiate Admin and User using `is_admin` field or Laravel Gates/Policies.
* Protect routes via **middleware** (`auth`, `admin`).

---

## ‚ö° AJAX and Timer Integration Best Practices

‚úÖ **Key Guidelines:**

* Use **AJAX requests for dynamic answer saving** to avoid full page reloads.
* Implement **timer logic in JS**, synced with server time to prevent manipulation.
* Auto-submit quiz form when timer ends using clean event listeners.

---

## üåê Deployment Best Practices

‚úÖ **Key Guidelines:**

* Use **GitHub for version control**, commit frequently with meaningful messages.
* Test locally before pushing to the main branch.
* Deploy on **shared hosting or cloud platforms (e.g. DigitalOcean, AWS Lightsail)** with `.env` environment configuration.

By following these **Laravel / PHP / MySQL / Bootstrap best practices**, the **Quiz Builder and Hosting Platform** will remain clean, scalable, and production-ready.
